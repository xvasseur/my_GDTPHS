Supplementary material for "Numerical approximation of port-Hamiltonian systems for hyperbolic or parabolic partial differential equations":
-------------------------------

A. Brugnoli, G. Haine, A. Serhani and X. Vasseur

This file contains supplementary Python codes and Jupyter notebooks for the manuscript "Numerical approximation of port-Hamiltonian systems for hyperbolic or parabolic partial differential equations" by A. Brugnoli, G. Haine, A. Serhani and X. Vasseur (version of July, 2020).

Provided notebooks:
-------------------

1) Wave equation: tutorial_wave_ode.ipynb [Section 5.1 of the manuscript]
2) Wave equation with mixed boundary conditions: tutorial_wave_dae.ipynb
3) Mindlin plate problem: tutorial_mindlin.ipynb [Section 5.2 of the manuscript]
4) Heat equation: tutorial_heat_dae.ipynb [Section 5.3 of the manuscript]

The codes and notebooks rely on a working installation of the FEniCS software and the assimulo package, all available in the public domain:
- FEniCS: www.fenicsproject.org, version 2019.1.0 
- assimulo: https://jmodelica.org/assimulo/ version 3.1

A README file is provided for the installation of the dependencies.

This research is supported by the project ANR-16-CE92-0028, entitled "Interconnected Infinite-Dimensional systems for Heterogeneous Media", INFIDHEM, financed by the French National Research Agency (ANR) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).
